The purpose of the project is to create a platform game in C with the following
requirements:

* One player character,
* At least 2 maps,
* At least 1 enemy with a dummy A.I.,
* At least 1 way to harm the player,
* At least 1 danger (another enemy, a trap, spikes, lava, or something else),
* A game over with an explicit screen,
* And a way to start over the game without exiting.
